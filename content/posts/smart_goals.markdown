title: Think S.M.A.R.T. - How S.M.A.R.T. Goals Help Performance
---

Every year around New Year’s, talk turns to New Year’s Resolutions and the unlikelihood of following those resolutions after the first month of January. Many gyms are full of gym goers in early January and quite roomy by March. Even if you have the best intentions at the start, goals are tough to stick with, whether they are personal or career-related. The same is true of organizations as a whole – meeting goals is hard to do.

Your and your team’s success depends on being able to set and meet goals. Following the S.M.A.R.T. criteria can help.

What are S.M.A.R.T. goals?
 This term first appeared in the 1980s in a management journal and the theory has continued to evolve with time. S.M.A.R.T. goals have clear criteria that help you and your team to identify your goals and then, more importantly, know if and when you have met them and if more progress is needed. 

Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals can be very useful for career development. In general, the theory behind S.M.A.R.T. goals is that specific goals are more useful and easier to reach than general goals. When you follow the S.M.A.R.T. criteria, you can break each goal down into different components. This makes larger goals seem much more doable. 

The most commonly used meanings of the acronym are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Specific stresses that a specific goal has a much better chance of being achieved than a general goal. Your career performance will benefit by setting small goals and achieving them. As you see your progress achieving small goals, your confidence for achieving greater goals will increase. A specific goal should answer the five W’s: 

Who:      Who is involved?

What:     What do I want to accomplish?

Where:    Identify a location.

When:     Establish a time frame.

Which:    Identify requirements and constraints.

Why:      Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal. 

Measurable emphasizes the importance of using concrete criteria for the achievement of your goal. Rather than saying you want to meet more contacts in your industry, plan on attending two networking events this week. 

Attainable means that the goal should push you and your team’s abilities but not be outlandish. But it should not set a below-par standard for achievement either. A goal that is too easy could just lead to procrastination.

Relevant stresses that the goal should matter and tie into your organization’s broader goals. It should also be relevant to the business and economic conditions as they are. Setting a goal to increase sales in a down industry during a recession by 500% may not be the most realistic goal. 

Time-bound ties into the fact that unless there is a deadline, goals are unlikely to be met. Set a time frame, whether it is 6 months or 6 weeks away, in which to achieve your goal. This ensures that the goal won’t be overtaken by small day-to-day crises that always occur. Then, as time goes on, continually check in on your progress towards the goal. 

With these S.M.A.R.T. criteria in place, you are on your way to reaching your performance goals. Your career can be greatly helped by applying this method in whichever areas you wish to grow.
